Recap Community Hour #5/ January 27th
 1月27日

Wit:

Hello everyone, shall we have a chat? 😊

大家好，我们聊聊好吗？😊

Roman:

Hi Family! So, the first update from me after the Binance Demo Day. Bulk deals have been deployed in the V2 preview. The landing page is also being worked on. You can see the current state already deployed. There will be a link with an easy modal to get / wrap more GATe, for example.

大家好！所以，我在Binance演示日后的第一次更新。V2预览版中部署了批量交易。登陆页面也在开发中。您可以看到当前状态已部署。例如，将有一个带有简单模式的链接，以获取/包装更多GATe。

I am currently working on several reported improvements and bug fixes. Like multi-select of assets from your wallet for a new deal. This will take a few days.

我目前正在进行一些报告中的改进和错误修复。比如从你的钱包中为新交易多选资产。这需要几天时间。

The next bigger step is migrating the bridge to V2 and preparing the switch so that V2 will be the primary market. The old market will still be accessible through a legacy subdomain domain.

下一个更大的步骤是将跨链桥迁移到V2，并准备好切换，使V2成为主要市场。旧市场仍然可以通过旧的子域名访问。

Also, the next milestone are the auctions, which we are already working on.

此外，下一个里程碑是拍卖，我们已经在努力。

Johalex:

Hello, yes😊

你好，是的😊

Wit:

Regarding the Demo Day. It went very well — we were the first to present. Have about 15–20 new contacts from there already. Talking to potential partners/investors 😊

关于演示日：进行得很顺利——我们是第一个上场的。已经有15-20个新联系人。正在与潜在合作伙伴/投资者交谈😊

You may want to check out the current MV2 Preview at https://v2.minted.vodka

您可能想在以下位置查看当前的MV2预览：https://v2.minted.vodka

Johalex:

in which part of the ecosystem there is greater interest on the part of those present in the demonstration. I assume that in MV2?

参与演示的人对生态系统的哪一部分更感兴趣。我猜是MV2？

Wit:

Yes, we had only 7–10min so we focused on MV2 as it offers so most lucrative growth potentials to investors.

是的，我们只有7-10分钟，所以我们专注于MV2，因为它为投资者提供了最有利可图的增长潜力。

But, of course, we also have shown our games, but only superficially

但是，当然，我们也展示了我们的游戏，但只是表面上

OphirNoor:

What was the most interesting questions that the potential investors did? Do they ask for any specific feature? about MV

潜在投资者提出的最有趣的问题是什么？他们是否要求提供任何特定功能？关于MV

Wit:

I think there were only two questions per project. In most cases very generic questions. In our case it was about a) our token supply and b) future revenue streams

我认为每个项目只有两个问题。在大多数情况下，问题都是非常笼统的。在我们的案例中，是关于a）我们的代币供应和b）未来的收入流

9 Projects, the Demo Day lasted over 2 hours

9个项目，演示日持续了2个多小时

OphirNoor:

I see

我懂了

Wit:

But we had the advantage to present to a “fresh” audience 😉

但我们有向“新鲜”观众展示的优势😉

OphirNoor:

this is very positive

这是非常积极的

About future revenue streams do they ask the time frame?

关于未来的收入流，他们会问时间框架吗？

Fabrizio:

Is someone scared about low supply (2M)?

有人害怕供应不足（2百万）吗？

Wit:

No, simply where we plan to have revenue. MV2 services (minting, trading, etc.) is the answer

不，只是我们计划的收入。MV2服务（造币、交易等）就是答案

Not that we know of. Another project has an even smaller supply (below 200,000 tokens I think)

据我们所知并非如此。另一个项目的供应量更小（我认为低于200000个代币）

Johalex:

the important thing is that our supply is adequate to our offer of services. on the contrary a too low supply would be a problem👌

重要的是我们的供应足以提供服务。相反，供应过低将是一个问题👌

Ophir Noor:

I mean are these going to be long term investors? Because I read the part of the new supply is deemed to be locked for new investors

我的意思是，这些人会成为长期投资者吗？因为我读到，新供应的部分被认为对新投资者是锁定的

Wit:

We are in early talks. Our objective is to find equity investors first (not token investors). Equity investors are usually more long-term (so at least 2–5 years). If we were to fundraise with tokens, we would ask for long-term vesting (min. 2–3 years or longer)

我们正在进行早期会谈。我们的目标是首先找到股票投资者（而不是代币投资者）。股票投资者通常更长期（因此至少2-5年）。如果我们用代币融资，我们会要求长期归属（至少2-3年或更长）

OphirNoor:

ok, great

好的，太好了

Wit:

We are not under much pressure, though, regarding current market conditions. The project is financed beyond this year. However, additional resources are welcome to upgrade our business side and development.

不过，就目前的市场状况而言，我们没有太大压力。项目资金能支持到今年之后。然而，我们欢迎更多资源来提升我们的业务和发展。

So, we keep building the product and our network and look around for arising opportunities and collaborations/partnerships.

因此，我们不断构建产品和网络，并四处寻找出现的机会和合作/伙伴关系。

Currently the market is in a downturn, so we don’t expect too much to happen on fundraising very soon.

目前市场处于低迷状态，所以我们预计短期内不会有太多的筹资活动。

In any case there are new partnerships forming, that you shall hear about soon 😊

无论如何，你们很快就会听说新的合作关系正在形成😊

OphirNoor:

Yes, there is the risk that new investors will ask even more discount

是的，新投资者可能会要求更多的折扣

Wit:

Yes, if we were to raise through tokens, we should expect a discount demand of 30–60%. But we are way too greedy with the tokens to accept that 😊

是的，如果我们通过代币筹集资金，我们预计会有30-60%的折扣需求。但我们对代币太贪婪了，无法接受😊

OphirNoor:

奥菲诺：

I completely agree

我完全同意

Johalex:

in agreement each GAT is very valuable🤝😊

在协议中，每个GAT都是非常有价值的🤝😊

Fabrizio:

法布里齐奥：

I have a technical question. To querying and manage data on blockchain, did you have a custom layer or are you using some existing product?

我有个技术问题。要查询和管理区块链上的数据，您是否有自定义层，或者您正在使用某些现有产品？

Roman:

It is all custom. There is no existing product that could do the stuff we needed 😄

这都是习俗。没有现成的产品可以满足我们的需求😄

Fabrizio:

法布里齐奥：

Ok. Is it explorable to a product? I known some people could be interested

好啊它是可探索的产品吗？我知道有些人可能会感兴趣

Roman:

The API is not yet open, but it could definitely be made so. At least for some parties. If you know people with a valid use case, we could talk about it!

API尚未开放，但它肯定可以开放。至少对一些派对来说是这样。如果你认识有有效用例的人，我们可以谈谈！

Wit:

Today 2 new use-cases for GAT have been deployed, so yes, it becomes more valuable 😊

今天已经部署了两个新的GAT用例，所以是的，它变得更有价值😊

1. GATe used for Bulk Deal payments &amp; fees

1.用于批量交易支付和费用的门

2. GATe used for Mystery Box payment &amp; fees

2.用于神秘盒付款和费用的门

Pete:

皮特：

User-configurable bulk deals and mystery boxes are really cool.

用户可配置的批量交易和神秘盒子非常酷。

Loving what I’ve seen so far…and with a couple of small tweaks it’ll be so user-friendly! :)

喜欢我迄今为止所看到的……并且通过一些小的调整，它将变得非常用户友好！：）

Johalex:

when do you think we can mint NTFs in MV2?

你认为我们什么时候可以在MV2中创建NTFs？

Wit:

Earliest by the end of Q1 (so earliest in March)

最早在第一季度末（最早在三月份）

Johalex:

😊👏I wait anxiously. my first nft will be minted in MintedVodka

😊👏我焦急地等待着。我的第一个nft是用薄荷伏特加调制的

Wit:

😊👍🏼 let me know

😊👍🏼 让我知道

Daigo:

Will the discount for new investors bases on the current price? I think it may be inappropriate if it is based on the current price.

新投资者的折扣会基于当前价格吗？我认为如果以目前的价格为基础，可能是不合适的。

Pete:

皮特：

Well indeed, investors will always want the best deal they can get…so being greedy we prefer not to make a deal at the current price. To be honest we do not have so many tokens even available for investors as opposed to other purposes, so we prefer investors interested in equity…

事实上，投资者总是希望能得到最好的交易……因此，出于贪婪，我们不希望以当前价格达成交易。老实说，相对于其他用途，我们甚至没有那么多可供投资者使用的代币，所以我们更喜欢对股票感兴趣的投资者…

Wit:

Daigo, as I said, we don’t do any fundraising with tokens in the near future. Perhaps with equity of the company.

Daigo，正如我所说，我们在不久的将来不会用代币进行任何筹款。也许是公司的股权。

Pete:

皮特：

After all, the growth fund is for growth, and if the investors can’t help us get enough growth from their investment for the tokens that they ask, then it’s not a good deal.

毕竟，增长基金是用于增长的，如果投资者不能帮助我们从他们的投资中获得足够的增长来购买他们要求的代币，那么这不是一个好交易。

Growth is better than money for the project…

对于这个项目来说，增长比金钱更好…

Chen Yency:

陈亦新：

Indeed right

确实正确

Wit:

we are looking for growth, first of all, indeed. And even if we find investors, we ask for value added (like advice, connections, etc.)

首先，我们确实在寻求增长。即使我们找到了投资者，我们也会要求增加价值（比如建议、人脉等）

Pete:

皮特：

Yup, investors who only offer cash (like the guy in the TG the other week) are really not interesting for the project.

是的，只提供现金的投资者（比如前几周TG的那个家伙）对这个项目真的不感兴趣。

Daigo:

ah looks like I missed something important. yea I have checked it.

看来我错过了一些重要的事情。是的，我查过了。

No problem to have more equity investors!

有更多的股票投资者没问题！

Wit:

😊👍🏼 I mean a really good long-term equity investor may get a minor allocation. But it is not something we actively look for. In fundraising in the near future we look mainly for equity investors.

😊👍🏼 我的意思是，一个真正优秀的长期股权投资者可能会得到一个小的配置。但这不是我们积极寻找的东西。在近期的筹资中，我们主要寻找股票投资者。

It’s hard to find investors who support and help projects as Binance Labs does. Binance Labs is indeed a “Ferrari” among investors — as far as we can judge. Good to be a part of Binance Labs family/portfolio! We have been offered different kinds of help/support beyond the incubation program.

很难找到像Binance实验室那样支持和帮助项目的投资者。据我们判断，比南斯实验室在投资者中确实是一辆“法拉利”。很高兴成为Binance实验室家族/组合的一员！除了孵化计划之外，我们还获得了各种各样的帮助/支持。

Johalex:

From my perspective, I see the delivery of the token for listing to Binance as valuable. and in fact a lauchpad with them would be fantastic. making binance our biggest partner is ideal. In fact, it can be seen that we are on the right track.🤞

从我的角度来看，我认为向Binance交付用于登录的令牌是有价值的。事实上，和他们一起玩lauchpad会很棒。让binance成为我们最大的合作伙伴是理想的选择。事实上，可以看出我们在正确的轨道上。🤞

this is really promising. it is fair to insist that it has been a gigantic achievement🔥🦾

这真的很有希望。公平地说，这是一项巨大的成就🔥🦾

OphirNoor:

奥菲诺：

Maybe an industrial partners would be perfect… like Samsung or MIcrosoft or even Google… I am dreaming

也许一个行业合作伙伴会很完美……比如三星、微软甚至谷歌……我在做梦

Wit:

👀🤔😅

👀🤔😅

OphirNoor:

奥菲诺：

Can you imagine what sort of door will open for them?

你能想象什么样的门会为他们打开吗？

Wit:

Our network’s growth is accelerating — that I can say 😉

我可以说，我们的网络正在加速增长😉

OphirNoor:

奥菲诺：

Instead of Google Photo, you will have Google NFT, using MV to create deal or mkt place

而不是谷歌照片，你将有谷歌NFT，使用MV创建交易或mkt的地方

Wit:

We are just getting started with MV 😊

我们才刚刚开始MV😊

Fabrizio:

法布里齐奥：

You are the unique german that saying Ferrari instead mercedes 😂

你是唯一一个说法拉利而不是梅赛德斯的德国人😂

Daigo:

it should be ‘Porsche’ there haha

应该是“保时捷”吧哈哈

Wit:

Ferrari is beyond all that 😉

法拉利超越了这一切😉

Daigo:

Will MV2.0 be deployed on ETH in Q1? Right now most of the great NFT communities are on ETH, connecting to them would be a good way at the community level.

威尔MV2。第1季度将在ETH上部署0？现在，大多数伟大的NFT社区都在ETH上，在社区层面上连接它们将是一种很好的方式。

Roman:

Yes, we will deploy the trading capabilities on ETH as soon as possible

是的，我们将尽快在ETH上部署交易功能

We wanted to fine tune the contracts before deploying on Ethereum as it costs a lot to make any changes

我们希望在部署到以太坊之前对合同进行微调，因为进行任何更改都需要花费大量成本

Johalex:

On the other hand. the new website is amazing, very suitable to the ecosystem. all the members of the team are showing an ability that impresses🔥

另一方面新网站非常棒，非常适合生态系统。团队的所有成员都表现出令人印象深刻的能力🔥

Fabrizio:

法布里齐奥：

do you remember my propose regarding zigzag liquidity trading ? Did you study it? I think it is a good choice to retrieve new liquidity

你还记得我关于曲折流动性交易的提议吗？你研究过了吗？我认为这是一个很好的选择，以恢复新的流动性

Roman:

With all the demo days and bulk deals tasks I did not have time to look at it, yet. But I will do over the weekend!

由于所有的演示日和批量交易任务，我还没来得及看它。但我会在周末做！

Fabrizio:

法布里齐奥：

Good .. It is becoming very interesting. More token have been listed

好的它变得非常有趣。更多令牌已被列出

Daigo:

Is the Reward system (part of the GATe supply) on MV2.0 still in the plan?

是MV2上的奖励系统（大门供应的一部分）。0还在计划中吗？

Wit:

Yes, but we have no exact mechanism for MV rewards yet. It is something we want to do in one way or another, though.

是的，但我们还没有MV奖励的确切机制。不过，这是我们想以某种方式做的事情。

Daigo:

the current mechanism for NFT market is what $LOOKS doing. I don’t know if it is good or not. But you will get a good mechanism for MV.

NFT市场的当前机制是$LOOKS在做什么。我不知道这是好是坏。但你会得到一个很好的MV机制。

Wit:

We have different approaches in mind: for MV rewards and for MV staking 😊

我们有不同的方法：MV奖励和MV赌注😊

Daigo:

haha after the change of your website, I almost forgot the idea of MV staking!

哈哈，在你的网站改变后，我几乎忘记了MV赌注的想法！

It has been in your mind for a long time.

它在你的脑海里已经存在很长时间了。

Wit:

Well, there are also different approaches how it can be done, that we discuss 😊

我们也讨论了不同的方法😊

Daigo:

no problem

没问题

Roman:

There was no reason for staking before any real use-cases such as fees collected on MV in GAT(e), but it is coming

在GAT（e）中对MV收取费用等任何实际使用案例之前，没有理由下注，但它即将到来

Wit:

The technology for staking has been already developed on our side to a certain extent

我方已经在一定程度上开发了立桩技术

Roman:

together with minting, where it will have the most impact

再加上造币，它将在哪里产生最大的影响

Johalex:

definitely have to do it. welcome staking!🥳

一定要这么做。欢迎光临！🥳

Johalex:

Has the CMC been requested regarding the modification of the Token offer and the change of name?

是否要求CMC修改代币优惠和更改名称？

Daigo:

I think the change of name will be requested after GATe minting

我想铸造大门后会要求更改名字

Wit:

As it is a separate contract (that already exists), we will create separate profiles at sites like CMC and CG

由于这是一份单独的合同（已经存在），我们将在CMC和CG等网站上创建单独的配置文件

it has not been done yet

还没有完成

Daigo:

BTW, is there any plan that signing some hottest NFT projects to only IMO in MV?

顺便问一句，有没有计划在MV中只向IMO签署一些最热门的NFT项目？

My friend, who working hard on white list in many NFT communities now, told me that this may be a great way to promote MV at the community level. Just like to have some popular bands after building a new shopping mall.

我的朋友现在在很多NFT社区的白名单上努力工作，他告诉我，这可能是在社区层面推广MV的一个好方法。就像在建了一个新的购物中心后有一些流行乐队一样。

Wit:

We are reaching out to brands and artists — if your friend can help us with that, it’d be very much appreciated! 😉

我们正在接触品牌和艺术家——如果您的朋友能帮助我们，我们将不胜感激！😉

Roman:

Okay guys, it was awesome talking to you all. I am back to work.14:03

好了，伙计们，和你们谈话真是太棒了。我回来工作了。14:03

Stay safe all!

大家注意安全！

Johalex:

Daigo:

非常感谢大家在这里度过一个社区小时，再见！

Wit:
